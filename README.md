# Reinforcement Learning in Digital Advertising
*Capstone Project for Georgia Institute of Technology MS in Analytics (OMSA)*

**By Anushital Sinha**

The goal of this project was to build a proof of concept reinforcement learning model to predict the best digital ad-website combination to run at any given point in time. We created a system to improve the efficiency of digital advertising by building a reinforcement learning based system to dynamically decide on ad creative and website combinations.

During the course of the project, a simulation environment was created along the lines of OpenAI's Gym framework with the capability to alter the expected performance by day of the week, week or year and holiday status. For the agent design, three models were tested: Thompson Sampling, Bayesian linear regression and Bayesian neural networks. The results showed that Thompson Sampling performed the best based on minimizing total regret of click-through-rate performance.
